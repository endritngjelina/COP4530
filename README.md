# COP 4530 – Data Structures (USF)

This repo includes all the projects I worked on during the COP 4530 – Data Structures course at the University of South Florida.

The assignments were made to teach how to implement and use common data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and hash tables. Everything here was written by me while learning how to write more efficient and structured code.

### ⚠️ Academic Honesty

This code is for personal reference and for showing what I’ve done in the course. If you’re a student taking the same class, **don’t copy any of this** into your own work. USF uses tools like **MOSS** that detect code similarities, and that could get you in trouble.
